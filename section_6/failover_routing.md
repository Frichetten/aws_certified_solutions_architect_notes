# Failover Routing Policy
Failover routing policies are used whn you want to create an active/passive set up. For example, you may want your primary site to be in EU-WEST-2 and your secondary DR Site in AP-SOURTHEAST-2.

Route53 will monitor the health of your primary site using a health check.

A health check monitors the health of your end points.
