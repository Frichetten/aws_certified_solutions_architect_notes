A web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.

Elasticache supports two open-source in-memor caching engines
* Memcached
* Redis

# Memcached vs Reddis
* Memcached is easier than Redis
* Redis covers more complex data types

# Exam Tips
* Use Elasticache to increase database and web application performance.
* Reddis is Multi-AZ
* You can do backups and restores of Reddis
* If you need to scale horizontally, use Memcached
