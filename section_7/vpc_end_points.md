## What is a VPC Endpoint
A VPC Endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.

## There are two types of VPC endpoints
* Interface Endpoints
* Gateway Endpoints

# Interface Endpoints
An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. The following services are supported.

# Gateway Endpoints
* S3
* DynamoDB
