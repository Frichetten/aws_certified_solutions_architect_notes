* IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions.
* The "root" account is the admin account. 
* New Users have no permissions when first created.
* New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created.
* These are not the same as a password. You cannot use the Access Key ID & Secret Access Key to Login to the console.
* You only get to view these once.
* Always setup MFA on your root account.
* You can create and customise your own password rotation policies.
